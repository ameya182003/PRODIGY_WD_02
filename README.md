## Description

The stopwatch web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface for measuring and recording time intervals.

CSS is applied for a visually appealing design, ensuring proper alignment and styling. JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing users to start, pause, reset the stopwatch, and record lap times, with the display updating in real-time.
